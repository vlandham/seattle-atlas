# Seattle Atlas

Provides convenient method to download Seattle related shapefiles and convert some of them to TopoJSON format.

Inspired by Bostock's [world-atlas](https://github.com/mbostock/world-atlas).

Idea copied from and based on Justin Palmer's [portland-atlas](https://github.com/Caged/portland-atlas).

## Prerequisites

Before you can run `make`, you’ll need to install `Node` and `ogr2ogr` and some other prereqs. If you are on Mac OS X, and using [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) then just run:

```bash
brew install node
brew install gdal
brew install cairo
```

And then, from this repository’s root directory, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

If you run into problems with installing `node-canvas`, you might need to setup your `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` like so:

```bash
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig
```

This comes from the [node-canvas OSX install](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/wiki/installation---osx) page.

All Make Targets can be run using make. Example:

```bash
make shp/buildings.shp
```

<b>shp/geo-names.shp</b>

Geographic Names Information System from [WA Ecology Dept](http://www.ecy.wa.gov/services/gis/data/data.htm)

### geoJSON

GeoJSON conversion should work for any of the above shapefiles. The make command uses `geo` as the sub-directory. So, for example, to make a geoJSON file for neighborhoods, it would look something like:

<b>geo/neighborhoods.json</b>

Note the `geo` prefix and the `.json` extension.

There are also a few geoJSON specific files:

<b>geo/starbucks.json</b> - location of all starbucks

### TopoJSON

<b>topo/neighborhoods.json</b>

<b>topo/parks.json</b>
